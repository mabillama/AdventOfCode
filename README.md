# Advent of Code Solutions by Marc Abillama

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. All solutions are written in JavaScript and executed using Node.js.

## Repository Location

This repository is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/mabillama/AdventOfCode](https://github.com/mabillama/AdventOfCode)

## Problem Descriptions and Inputs

Each problem will have a link provided for the problem's explanation. Note that while the problems are the same for all participants, the input is unique to each user. Therefore, while the solutions are generic, the results may vary based on the specific inputs provided by Advent of Code.

## Structure

- Each year of the challenge has its own directory named by the year, e.g., `2020`, `2021`, etc.
- Inside each year's directory, there are individual directories for each day of the challenge, named `day01`, `day02`, and so on.
- For each day, the main solution file can be found as `day_[two-digit day number].js`.
- Smaller samples for each challenge are stored in `day_[two-digit day number]_sample.js`.
- Input samples for the challenges can be found as `day_[two-digit day number]_sample.txt`.

## Execution

To run the solutions:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the solution you want to run.
3. Ensure the respective sample or input file is present in the same folder.
4. Execute the solution using Node.js:

   ```
   node day_[two-digit day number].js
   ```
